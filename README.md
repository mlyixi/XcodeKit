# XcodeKit

This is a library I wrote that parses Xcode `.pbxproj` project files. While it doesn’t write the files out _exactly_ the way Xcode itself does (i.e. there are some indentation differences), it should come pretty close.

XcodeKit is an Objective-C port of [Ray Yamamoto Hilton](https://ray.sh/)’s wonderful [`xcoder`](https://github.com/rayh/xcoder) Ruby gem. Some portions are also borrowed from the CocoaPods [Xcodeproj gem](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj). Many thanks!
